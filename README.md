<h1 style="text-align:center">PCA-Optimized Wine Data Clustering: An Advanced Analytical Approach to Viniculture Data Stratification</font></h1>  

## Overview

This README provides documentation for "PCA-Optimized Wine Data Clustering," a comprehensive Python project by Sai Narayan, utilizing Apache Spark for analyzing wine data. The project implements Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for data stratification, focusing on optimizing clustering of wine characteristics. The project's main aim is to apply advanced data analysis techniques to viniculture data, improving the understanding of wine properties and their clustering patterns.

## Program Functionality

1. **Data Preparation and Normalization**: Utilizes PySpark to load and preprocess wine data. Features are standardized using `StandardScaler`.

2. **PCA Implementation**: Principal Component Analysis is applied to reduce dimensionality. The program experiments with different numbers of components to explain a specified variance in the data.

3. **K-Means Clustering**: The project applies K-Means clustering to the PCA-transformed features. A custom function `fit_kmeans` is defined for flexible clustering, handling various column inputs and cluster numbers.

4. **Visualization**: Clustered data is visualized in a 2D scatter plot, showcasing the effectiveness of PCA in clustering enhancement. The project also compares clustering results using original features and PCA features.

5. **Performance Evaluation**: The program evaluates clustering performance using the Elbow and Silhouette methods, analyzing the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) and silhouette scores for different numbers of clusters.

## Notes

- The project showcases the utility of PCA in enhancing clustering results, specifically in the context of wine data analysis.
- The visualization step is crucial for understanding the clustering patterns and the effectiveness of PCA in data stratification.
- Users should be familiar with PySpark and basic data science concepts to fully leverage this project.
- The project is customizable, allowing exploration of different numbers of principal components and cluster centers.
- Future improvements could include additional data preprocessing steps, exploration of other clustering algorithms, and integration with more advanced visualization tools.
